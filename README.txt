Project: Bytesize Stories UI Redesign
Client: Kathleen Kelly
Group Members: Nick Landry, Ben Isenhart, Xander Fermier

This project is a UI redesign of the Bytesize Stories website for Kathleen Kelly's doctorate thesis. The goal of the website is to teach computer science topics to middle/high school students by using AI to teach students through storytelling. To this end, the project maintains a whimsical look while providing story generation and viewing functionalities as well as account management user interfaces. We hope that this website helps to make the project a success. Thank you for reading this readme! :D
